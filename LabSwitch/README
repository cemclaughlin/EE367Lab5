For each setup: P1(local) (net.c):
>>use getaddrinfo() on own info
>>run for loop{
	>socket() gets new/next useable socketfd(file descriptor, index/identifier-ish)
	>setsockopt() settings/options 
	>bind() "assigning a name to the socket"
>>listen() create a passive listening socket

P2(non-local) (packet.c): //cannot use connect until destination is created
		//cannot connect twice without closing (probably)
//copy client.c, tack on close() at end
>>use getaddrinfo() on other address/port
>>use socket() to get info
